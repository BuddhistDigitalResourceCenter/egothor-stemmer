# Egothor Trie

This repository contains the code of `org.egothor.stemmer` slightly modified and renamed `io.bdrc.egothorstemmer`. 

The main goal of this repository is
- easy Maven distribution (distribution on Sonatype ossrh)
- small jar containing only these files, not the whole egothor 2 project
- simple git access
- bug tracker
- fixes not yet publicly available

We keep track of the changes we make to the Egothor code in the [Change Log](CHANGELOG.md).
